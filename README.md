# 📝 pyjournal-shrey

*Because your thoughts deserve better than a messy Notes app*

Hey there! 👋 

You know that feeling when you want to jot down your thoughts, but every app feels like overkill? Or when you're deep in terminal work and switching to a GUI feels like breaking your flow? Yeah, I've been there too.

That's exactly why I built **pyjournal-shrey** – a journal that lives where developers actually spend their time: the command line. No fancy interfaces, no distractions, just you and your thoughts.

Whether you're documenting that "aha!" moment when code finally works, processing a tough day, or tracking your learning journey, this little tool becomes your digital thinking companion.

## ✨ What makes it special?

Look, I could list a bunch of features, but here's what really matters:

**It's stupidly simple to use.** Type a command, add your thoughts, done. No sign-ups, no cloud sync anxiety, no "where did I put that entry?" moments.

**Your workflow stays intact.** Already living in the terminal? Perfect. You never have to leave your coding zone to capture that brilliant insight or vent about a frustrating bug.

**It grows with you.** Started with simple daily notes? Cool. Want to tag everything and build a searchable knowledge base? Also cool. The tool adapts to however your brain works.

Here's what's under the hood:
- 📝 **Lightning-fast entries** – Capture thoughts faster than opening any app
- 🏷️ **Tagging that actually works** – #work #personal #ideas – organize however makes sense to you
- 🔍 **Search that remembers** – "What was that thing I wrote about React hooks last month?" Found it.
- 📖 **Your story in chronological order** – Watch your thoughts and growth unfold over time
- 📤 **Export without vendor lock-in** – Your words, your markdown files, your control
- 🚀 **Zero bloat** – Fast, lightweight, and always available

Built for developers, but honestly? Anyone who values their thoughts and wants to keep them organized will love this.

## 🚀 Getting started

Ready to give it a shot? Here's literally all you need to do:

```bash
pip install pyjournal-shrey
```

That's it. No accounts, no complex setup, no "please restart your terminal 47 times." Just install and start journaling.

## 💡 Your first 30 seconds

Once it's installed, here's how most people start:

```bash
# Your very first entry (the hardest part is starting!)
pyjournal add "Trying out this new journal tool. So far so good! #first-entry"

OR

journal add "Trying out this new journal tool. So far so good! #first"


# See what you've written
pyjournal view

# Look for something specific
pyjournal search "journal"

# Export everything when you want to back up or share
pyjournal export my-thoughts.md
```

**Pro tip:** Don't overthink it. Just start writing. Your future self will thank you for capturing today's thoughts, even if they seem mundane right now.

## 🤝 Want to make it better?


Open an issue, submit a PR, or just drop a line about how you're using it. This is a passion project, and seeing how it helps other people think and grow is honestly the best part.

Plus, if you're learning to contribute to open source, this might be a friendly place to start. The codebase is small, documented, and I promise to be encouraging rather than nitpicky.
